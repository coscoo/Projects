# Projects
These are projects I've completed in the past year.


BOT-  Electronic Trading bot used to compete in the Jane Street AMP ETC Trading competition.


Anagame- First project where I created a terminal based game which compares two words and determines if you found a qualifying anagram, has an AI portion that includes simulations to 
see if your guess was optimal.

Camel_Up- A terminal based game that is a replica of the camel up board game.

Wordle- A Terminal based game that is a replica of the wordle game and has an AI element.
